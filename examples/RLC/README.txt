Main scripts:
-------------

- RLC_generate_train.py: generate the training dataset
- RLC_generate_test.py: generate the test dataset
- RLC_train_1step.py: train with a 1-step-ahead method, as discussed in [1]
- RLC_train_ae.py: train with a multi-step-ahead method, using an LSTM for state estimation.
  Similar to [3] and [4], but with a recurrent encoder network
- RLC_test.py: plot model simulation on a test dataset and compute metrics
