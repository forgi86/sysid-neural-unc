Main scripts:
-------------

- CTS_train_truncated.py: train with a multi-step-ahead method, estimate full state sequence along
  with the model parameters as done in [1] and [2]
- CTS_train_full.py: train with a multi-step-ahead method, estimate
- CTS_test.py: plot model simulation on a test dataset and compute metrics
